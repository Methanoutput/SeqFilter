Project setup:

Step 1. Identify a question that you want to investigate. This can be from the perspective of biology or medicine or completely unrelated.
Important: Do not use confidential data that is not be shared outside of a e.g. a lab group.

Step 2. Formulate your question and outline what you want to do and let us check on it.

Step 3. Start your project. Hand in latest on 23 April 2023 11.59PM.

Step 4. Meeting with us to discuss your code. 15min slot between 8-12 May.


What do you have to hand in?

1.) all required input files
2.) script(s) (or Jupyter Notebook file) including description & explanation of your code using #
3.) if you created intermediated files that you had to modify outside of your script(s) (e.g. if you used multiple smaller scripts and modified output of script 1 using commands from lecture 1 or 2 before it went into script 2) please hand in your code for this and all intermediate files

Some side notes:

-to pass your code needs to work as you have intended
-We should be able to get it running based on your description
-we will not check efficiency or simplicity
-use what you know (you do not have to implement all applications we introduced)
-our main goal is that you understood what you have done


You can either outline a project of your own or take one of those that we provide you in studIP.
